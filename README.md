# JobNimbus Activity to Google Chat Notification

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that receives a webhook from JobNimbus (via a Pipedream proxy) when a specific activity note is created and sends a formatted notification to a Google Chat space.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1.  **JobNimbus Automation**: An automation rule triggers when an "Activity is Created" that matches specific keywords (e.g., "Document Created").
2.  **Pipedream Proxy**: JobNimbus sends a webhook with the activity note to a Pipedream workflow, which acts as a secure proxy.
3.  **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Pipedream securely calls this repository's GitHub Actions workflow. The workflow parses the note, formats a message, and sends it to Google Chat.

## ðŸ§± Setup Guide

### Phase 1: GitHub Setup

1.  **Confirm this Repository is Correct**: Ensure your repository contains the `.github/workflows/jobnimbus-webhook.yml` file.
2.  **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**:
    * Go to **Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)**.
    * Generate a new token with the `repo` scope.
    * Copy the token immediately. You will need it for Pipedream.
3.  **Add Secrets to this Repository**:
    * Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
    * Ensure you have a secret named `GCHAT_WEBHOOK_URL` containing the webhook URL for your Google Chat space.

### Phase 2: Pipedream Setup

1.  **Create a Pipedream Workflow**:
    * Go to Pipedream.com and create a new workflow with an **HTTP / Webhook** trigger.
    * Copy the unique webhook URL Pipedream provides.
2.  **Add a Node.js Code Step**:
    * Add a **Run Node.js code** step and use the appropriate script to call the GitHub API `dispatches` endpoint.
    * Connect your GitHub account to the step to securely use your PAT.
    * **Deploy** the workflow.

### Phase 3: JobNimbus Setup

1.  **Create the Automation Rule**:
    * **Trigger**: When an **Activity** is **Created**.
    * **Conditions**: If **Type** is equal to **Note** and the note contains your desired keywords (e.g., 'Document Created').
    * **Action**: **Webhook POST**.
2.  **Configure the Webhook**:
    * **URL**: Paste the **Pipedream URL** from Phase 2.
    * **Body (Payload)**: Use the following JSON to send the necessary data:
        ```json
        {
          "note": "{{Note}}",
          "jnid": "{{JnId}}"
        }
        ```
3.  **Save** the automation rule.
